<blockquote>
  <p>In a famous experiment conducted less than a year after Heisenberg's (1925) enunciation of the Principle of Indeterminacy, Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) probed the depths of his honey-pot to be certain that it was truly honey within, all the way to the bottom. The probe was successful. On completion of the probing, however, the honey-pot no longer contained honey. Furthermore, Pooh's head was stuck in the pot.</p>
  <p>We conclude, with Pooh and Heisenberg:</p>
  <p>THE SYSTEM IS ALTERED BY THE PROBE USED TO TEST IT</p>
