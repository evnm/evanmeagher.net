<blockquote>
  <p>In a famous experiment conducted less than a year after Heisenberg's (1925) enunciation of the Principle of Indeterminacy, Winnie-the-Pooh (1926) probed the depths of his honey-pot to be certain that it was truly honey within, all the way to the bottom. The probe was successful. On completion of the probing, however, the honey-pot no longer contained honey. Furthermore, Pooh's head was stuck in the pot.</p>

  <p>Steely gray in winter, dim and dove-like in spring, cloaked in fog in fall—Seattle’s weather is one of its bitter joys. Our famous rain is abstract, diffuse. More cotton ball than sheet, it is a woozy, three-dimensional rain that softens the city’s hard corners. Calling up moss and mushroom and penetrating everywhere with a kind of psychic damp, the climate almost literally grows into you.
