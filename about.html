<h1>About the author</h1>

<p>First off, Meagher is pronounced "mar", as in the planet. Derived from a Gaelic word meaning “hospitable”, it’s the un-anglicized equivalent of Maher (as in Bill).</p>

<p>Born, raised, and matriculated in the Pacific Northwest (a region that I've increasingly grown to associate with as time progresses), I work on the Core Services team at Twitter. This is fancy org-speak for the team that builds out the SOA infrastructure that's helped Twitter scale and develop products more flexibly.</p>

<p>Over the past decade, I’ve worked as a web developer, as a research assistant on a distributed computing project, and as an intern on the Google Maps team.</p>

<p>Off the clock, I've worked on various open source projects and built a few standalone applications, including <a href="http://eureka.evanmeagher.net">a random invention generator</a> and <a href="http://www.gingrsnap.com">a recipe cataloguing service</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to making a career out of thinking about problems and typing, I enjoy cooking, consuming good food and beverages, and listening to a wide variety of music.</p>
