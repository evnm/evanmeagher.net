<h1>About the author</h1>
<p>First off, <a href="http://pronouncenames.com/search?name=meagher">my last name is pronounced "mar"</a>. It’s the un-anglicized equivalent of Maher and is derived from a Gaelic word meaning “hospitable”.</p>
<p>I hail from Olympia, WA, USA and received a BS in computer science at the University of Washington in Seattle. I currently live and work in San Francisco, CA as a software engineer at Twitter with a focus on the construction and scalability of distributed systems. In my time at Twitter, I've operated a number of the core services that underpin the company's products and collaborated on libraries and tools that help others develop software more flexibly. Many of the projects I work on are open source <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle/">and</a> <a href="https://github.com/twitter/util/">available</a> <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twitter-server">on</a> <a href="https://github.com/twitter/scrooge">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, I’ve worked as a web developer, as a research assistant on a distributed computing project, and as an intern on the Google Maps team.</p>
<p>Off the clock, I read a lot, cook, and listen to as much music as possible. I've built a few standalone applications as side projects, including <a href="http://www.gingrsnap.com">a recipe cataloguing service</a> and <a href="http://eureka.evanmeagher.net">a random invention generator</a>.</p>
