<h1>About the author</h1>

<p>Contrary to conventional spelling or reason my last name is pronounced “mar.” Derived from a Gaelic word meaning “hospitable”, it’s the un-anglicized equivalent of Maher (as in Bill).</p>

<p>I’m an engineer at Twitter, working on infrastructure as part of the platform services team. That means that I write and maintain code that lets Twitter scale as the product and userbase grow. I graduated from the University of Washington in 2011 with a degree in computer science. Over the past decade, I’ve worked under the catchall role of web designer/developer, as a research assistant on a distributed computing project, and as an intern on the Google Maps team.</p>

<p>Off the clock, I've worked on various open source projects and built a few standalone applications, including <a href="http://eureka.evanmeagher.net">a random invention generator</a> and <a href="http://www.gingrsnap.com">a recipe organization service</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to making a career out of thinking about problems and typing, I enjoy cooking, drinking tea, playing drums, and listening to a wide variety of music.</p>
