<h1>About the author</h1>
<p>First off, my last name is pronounced &ldquo;mar&rdquo; <a href="#fn1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I grew up in Olympia, WA, USA and studied computer science at the University of Washington in Seattle. I live in San Francisco, CA and work in Oakland as a software developer at an energy sensing company called <a href="http://whiskerlabs.com">Whisker Labs</a>.</p>
<p>I worked on backend infrastructure at Twitter from 2011 to 2015. I operated a number of the core services that underpin its products and collaborated on open source technologies that help others develop software more flexibly. Many of these projects that I worked on <a href="https://github.com/twitter/finagle/">are</a> <a href="https://github.com/twitter/util/">available</a> <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twitter-server">on</a> <a href="https://github.com/twitter/scrooge">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Off the clock, I read, cook, and consume as much music as possible. I contribute to open source projects and have built a few standalone applications as side projects, including <a href="http://www.gingrsnap.com">a recipe cataloging service</a> and <a href="http://eureka.evanmeagher.net">a random invention generator</a>.</p>

<section class="footnotes">
  <p id="fn1">[1] <a href="http://pronouncenames.com/search?name=meagher"><em>Meagher</em></a> is the un-anglicized equivalent of Maher (as in Bill Maher). In addition to being fundamentally unpronounceable, it's derived from an Irish Gaelic word meaning &ldquo;hospitable&rdquo;.</p>
