<h1>About the author</h1>
<p>First off, <a href="http://pronouncenames.com/search?name=meagher">Meagher is pronounced "mar"</a>. Derived from a Gaelic word meaning “hospitable”, it’s the un-anglicized equivalent of Maher (as in Bill).</p>
<p>Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, I currently live and work in San Francisco. I work on the Core Systems Libraries team at Twitter, which is fancy org-speak for writing libraries and tools that help Twitter scale and develop products more flexibly.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, I’ve worked as a web developer, as a research assistant on a distributed computing project, and as an intern on the Google Maps team.</p>
<p>Off the clock, I've worked on various open source projects and built a few standalone applications, including <a href="http://eureka.evanmeagher.net">a random invention generator</a> and <a href="http://www.gingrsnap.com">a recipe cataloguing service</a>.</p>
