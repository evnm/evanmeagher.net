It's been a little over two weeks since I graduated from college. Tomorrow I'll pack my life into a truck and begin [the 800-mile journey](http://twitter.com/) from Seattle to San Francisco.

This move has been the light at the end of my tunnel for the past six months. In December, I turned down a job at Google Seattle in favor of one at Twitter, to the bewilderment of many of my friends and family. With a new city and an exciting job looming on the horizon, I've spent [the first half of 2011](http:google.com) finishing my last two quarters of school and mentally preparing myself for a head-first dive into Silicon Valley.

As I begin a new chapter of my life, it seems like as good a time as any to take a crack at my lofty, neglected goal of writing more. Thus, I've created this blog on which to write about things that interest me. Stay tuned to see if I follow through.
