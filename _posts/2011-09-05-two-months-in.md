title: "Two months in"

Like countless others on the internet, I've been "meaning to write more" for a long time. Under the assumption that Wordpress puts too much process into the task of blogging, I've designed a new personal website using [a simpler tool](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Hopefully the ability to write essays using the same workflow that I use to write code will grease the wheels of expression.

My old Wordpress site is now accessible at [old.evanmeagher.net](http://old.evanmeagher.net). The new site is hosted on GitHub and its source is available [here](https://github.com/evnm/evnm.github.com).

Last friday was the two month mark of my employment at Twitter, Inc. I don't think that I could be happier with my current situation. Twitter is proving to be exactly the workplace that I was hoping for: a friendly and open atmosphere with brilliant coworkers more than willing to help me learn everything that I can as quickly as possible. Coming out of college, it's exactly the kind of environment that I want to be in to further my technical education.

As for the contents of this blog, I intend to write about what I learn. At the moment, this would include things about Scala, functional programming, and distributed systems, but my interests are bound to ebb and flow as I work on different projects and interact with different people.

To keep up to date with me, you can [subscribe to this blog](http://evanmeagher.net/atom.xml) or [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/evanm) for more granular updates.
